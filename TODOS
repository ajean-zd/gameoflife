some ideas...

* We currently print game of life to the screen, but we could make it look a lot nicer
* User input: pause, play, go back one step, go forward one step...
* revisit the .cells spec and make sure we are reading it properly (e.g. header, comments)
* better performance for very large populations, 2d array probably gets very slow
* configuration, e.g., playback speed (.cellsrc ??)
